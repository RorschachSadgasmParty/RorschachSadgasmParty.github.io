<h1 style="decoration: underline; font-size: 1.2em;">Dawn Chorus</h1>
<p>The night and the dark took me
a sad song from a time when I was hopeless came on by chance
a sort of sweet & sad acceptance came over me
a smile, but also tears threatening a little
I looked at the room which was rearranged, but unmistakably the place I’d spent the past 5 years
The place I’d spent alone, experiencing experience after experience in isolation,
thought and feeling never shared
And it’s ok that I can’t share it, 
at least it will be when I accept that. For now it makes me sad,
but the song that came on is the embrace of an ambivalent universe, it is like the night sky when I’m alone in the wilderness, the ridge when I’m crying.
But I think the feeling I felt when the song came on & I smiled, sadly, & felt a little like tearing up,
says a hell of a lot more, & that experience cannot be put into words, at least not by me.
There's something unique and special about my experience in that regard, something incredibly isolating as well.
There is only the here and now</p>
