<h1 style="decoration: underline; font-size: 1.2em;">Dawn Chorus</h1>
<p>The night and the dark took me<br>
a sad song from a time when I was hopeless came on by chance<br>
a sort of sweet & sad acceptance came over me<br>
a smile, but also tears threatening a little<br>
I looked at the room which was rearranged, but unmistakably the place I’d spent the past 5 years<br>
The place I’d spent alone, experiencing experience after experience in isolation,<br>
thought and feeling never shared<br>
And it’s ok that I can’t share it, <br>
at least it will be when I accept that. For now it makes me sad,<br>
but the song that came on is the embrace of an ambivalent universe, it is like the night sky when I’m alone in the wilderness, the ridge when I’m crying.<br>
But I think the feeling I felt when the song came on & I smiled, sadly, & felt a little like tearing up,<br>
says a hell of a lot more, & that experience cannot be put into words, at least not by me.<br>
There's something unique and special about my experience in that regard, something incredibly isolating as well.<br>
There is only the here and now</p>
